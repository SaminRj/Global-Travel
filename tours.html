                                    National Geographic Traveller offers insights on planning an epic around-the-world journey. Air travel remains the simplest way to traverse the globe. Keep in mind a few key rules: maintain one global direction (east or west), cross the Atlantic and Pacific oceans only once each, start and finish in the same country, and travel for a period between 10 days and one year. Convenience is a plus, as it minimizes paperwork. <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/how-to-plan-a-trip-around-the-world">read more...</a>

                                            Istanbul is a major city in Turkey that straddles Europe and Asia across the Bosphorus Strait. Its Old City reflects cultural influences of the many empires that once ruled here. In the Sultanahmet district, the open-air, Roman-era Hippodrome was for centuries the site of chariot races, and Egyptian obelisks also remain. The iconic Byzantine Hagia Sophia features a soaring 6th-century dome and rare Christian mosaics.
