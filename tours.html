                                    National Geographic Traveller offers insights on planning an epic around-the-world journey. Air travel remains the simplest way to traverse the globe. Keep in mind a few key rules: maintain one global direction (east or west), cross the Atlantic and Pacific oceans only once each, start and finish in the same country, and travel for a period between 10 days and one year. Convenience is a plus, as it minimizes paperwork. <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/travel/article/how-to-plan-a-trip-around-the-world">read more...</a>
